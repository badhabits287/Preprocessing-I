					<h1>Javier A Gutierrez</h1>
					<p>Born and raised in Montevideo, Uruguay.

						whatever i could get a hold of.
						After migrating to the United States, i have explored many
						different career paths from Antique restoration, Book illustrator, Urban Sketching
						, Professional tattoo
						artist and currently boiler mechanic, where i fell in love with the mechanics and basic
						programming of machinery.
